The printf function sends formatted output to stdout.
A custom _printf() for learning purposes was developed by cohort #15 student taking ALX software engineerging program.

_printf() function format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. 
These arguments are placed using the percentage '%' operator.

#### Authorized functions and macros


write (man 2 write)
malloc (man 3 malloc)
free (man 3 free)
va_start (man 3 va_start)
va_end (man 3 va_end)
va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

#### Compilation:alembic:



The code must be compiled this way:

**$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c**


------------

#### Use & Examples


------------

**Prototype:** int _printf(const char *format, ...);
**Use - General:** _printf("format string", var1, var2, ...);

**Examples:**
 - Basic String: _printf("%s Alx", "Hello");`
	 - Output: Hello Alx

- Print integers: _printf("This is an array element: arr[%d]:%c", 32, arr[32]);`
	- Output: This is an array element arr[32]:A

Many other specifiers and flags were added and by combinig those the _printf() function generate a different ouput. The following list are the specifiers and flags allowed.

## Tasks required for this project


------------

0. ### I am not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I am a Spur for life1.
Write a function that produces output according to a format.
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
- c
- s
- %

1. ##### Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you dont
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
- d
- i

2. ##### Just because its in print doesn't mean its the gospel
Create a man page for the function.

3. ##### With a face like mine, I do better in print
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
- b

4. ##### What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
- u
- x
- o
- x
- X

5. ##### Nothing in fine print is ever good news
Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible. (not done)

6. ##### Handle the following custom conversion specifier
- S : prints the string.
- Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters).

7. ##### How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print
Handle the following conversion specifier: p

8. ##### The big print gives and the small print takes away
Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers: (not done)
- ´+´
- space
- ´#´ 

9. ##### Sarcasm is lost in print
Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers: (not done)
- l
- h
Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X

10. ##### Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests
Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers. (not done)

11. ##### The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance
Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers. (not done)

12. ##### It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print
Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers. (not done)

13. ##### Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection
Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers. (not done)

14. ##### Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
 - r : prints the reversed string

15. ##### [The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring] 
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
- R: prints the rot13'ed string

16. ##### *
All the above options work well together. (not done)
